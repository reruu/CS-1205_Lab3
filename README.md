## 📝 **SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM**
The project ${\color{lightgreen}Bob \space the \space Builder's \space Simple \space Tool \space Maintenance }$ was designed to show how to properly define an __**abstract class**__, implement the concept of __**inheritance**__ correctly,
and show how to __**override the abstract methods**__ properly. This project showcases these key concepts through a simple example of ${\color{lightgreen}Tool \space Maintenance }$—opening the toolbox, performing a maintenance on every tool, then finally closing the toolbox.
