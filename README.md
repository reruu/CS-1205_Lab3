## 📝 **SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM**
The project ${\color{pink}Bob \space the \space Builder's \space Simple \space Tool \space Maintenance }$ was designed to show how to properly define an __**abstract class**__, implement the concept of __**inheritance**__ correctly,
and show how to __**override the abstract methods**__ properly. 

Each tool class extends `Tool` and overrides its abstract method `use_tool()`, while also introducing unique behaviors such as `add_nail()`, `sharpen()`, or `adjust()`. Through this structure, the system models how **_inheritance_**, **_method overriding_**, and **_data encapsulation_** work together in real-world software design.

The program runs through a complete tool usage cycle—**opening the toolbox**, **performing maintenance actions**, and **returning the tools**—illustrating key OOP techniques in a practical and visual way!

## 🔍 **HIGHLIGHTS**
📦 Abstract Base Class: All tools inherit from a shared abstract class, `Tool`, that defines the interface via the `use_tool()` method <br /><br />
🧰 Diverse Tool Classes: Includes specialized tools such as `Hammer`, `Chisel`, `Screwdriver`, `Wrench,` `Handsaw`, and `Sandpaper` <br /><br />
✅ Data Validation: Uses Python property decorators (`@property`, `@weight.setter`) to ensure valid inputs (e.g., `weight > 0`) <br /><br />
🔁 Dynamic Polymorphism: Each tool redefines `use_tool()` for tool-specific actions and messages <br /><br />
🔧 Realistic Methods: Custom methods like `change_bit()`, `smooth()`, `cut()`, `add_nail()` reflect real tool functions <br/><br />
🪛 Sequential Flow: Simulates the process of maintaining each tool one by one, then returning it to the toolbox

## __📜 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT__
Our group would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who supported the development of this coding project on Object-Oriented Programming using Python language.

To ***Our Almighty God***, for providing us the strength and intelligence to make this project a success,

To ***Ma'am Fatima Marie Agdon***, for providing us with sufficient learning resources and guiding us through the way in creating this project,

Lastly, to ***our team***, for showcasing great cooperation and initiative in kickstarting this project and committing to finishing it.


This project has deepened our understanding of core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract methods in a Pythonic context. 
And we will never have accomplished it to this level if it weren't for these people. We hereby express our deepest gratitude to all these people.
